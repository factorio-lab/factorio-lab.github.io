This is the repository for the [FactorioLab](https://factoriolab.github.io) project, a tool for calculating resource and factory requirements for the games [Factorio](https://factorio.com), [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/), and [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/).  
This project is intended to build on the features of the Kirk McDonald [Factorio Calculator](https://kirkmcdonald.github.io) ([GitHub](https://github.com/KirkMcDonald/kirkmcdonald.github.io)). It is built from the ground up using Angular, Redux, and Typescript.

**For instructions on how to use this tool,** check out the [wiki](https://github.com/factoriolab/factorio-lab/wiki).

**To submit suggestions or issues,** please check out the [issues page](https://github.com/factoriolab/factorio-lab/issues).
